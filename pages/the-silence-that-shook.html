    <h1>The Silence that Shook</h1>
    <p>There was nothing left to say. Nothing to prove. The body had gone silent. The soul had revealed itself.</p>
    <p>In the space where breath makes no sound, I heard it. It was an ancient beat. A forgotten vibration.</p>
    <p>It was neither a voice, nor a thought. It was a memory. A memory of who I was before I became me.</p>
    <p>I was no longer a man. Nor a name. I was the trembling of silence. The memory of stars. The echo of a truth that needed no explanation.</p>
    <p>The world around me faded. Not because it was dying… but because I was being born.</p>
    <p>I remained. Present. Empty. Full. Aware.</p>
    <p>And in that vibrant void, I knew I had never been separated. That there was no return. Because I had never left.</p>
